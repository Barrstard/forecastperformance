# Forecast Comparison Implementation - Phase 1 Complete

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the hierarchical forecast model comparison workflow for the Sales Forecast Comparison App. The system now supports creating comparison models, loading actuals and forecast data from multiple sources, and running comparative analyses.

## Database Schema Updates

### New Models Added

1. **ForecastComparisonModel** - Parent container for organizing forecast comparisons
   - Links to environment, contains period settings, and manages status
   - One-to-one relationship with actuals dataset
   - One-to-many relationships with forecast datasets and comparison runs

2. **ActualsDataset** - Single source of truth data for comparisons
   - Supports multiple data sources (BigQuery, file upload, API)
   - Tracks loading status and metadata
   - Links to comparison model and actual volumes

3. **ForecastDataset** - Individual forecast model data for comparison
   - Supports various model types (UKG Dimensions, ML, statistical, etc.)
   - Multiple data source support
   - Links to comparison model and volume forecasts

4. **ComparisonRun** - Analysis execution comparing forecasts against actuals
   - Configurable forecast selection and filters
   - Tracks execution status and results
   - Stores accuracy metrics and statistical analysis

5. **ComparisonResult** - Detailed comparison results for analysis
   - Individual data point comparisons
   - Calculated error metrics and accuracy scores
   - Links to comparison run and forecast dataset

### Schema Modifications

- **VVolumeForecast** - Added optional `forecastDatasetId` field for new structure
