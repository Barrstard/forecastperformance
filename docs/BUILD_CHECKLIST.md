## Current Status: Phase 1 - Foundation Setup
**Started**: [Current Date]
**Next Priority**: Set up proper Next.js structure and install missing dependencies

## Notes
- V0 components analyzed and design patterns identified
- Current project has basic Next.js setup with shadcn/ui
- Need to add Prisma, BigQuery, and other enterprise dependencies
- Database schema needs to be designed for massive datasets (2.8+ billion data points)
- Focus on dynamic BigQuery project ID extraction from credentials
